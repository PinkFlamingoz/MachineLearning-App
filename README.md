# MachineLearning-App
 A app where a self driving car learns to overtake cars.
 
 ## How to run the app
 1.Either fork or download the app and open the folder in your prefered IDE.
 2.Install live server extension if you use visual studio code.
 3.Right click on the `index.html` file and click `open with live server`.
 
 ## How to use the app
 1.From the menu on the left side set up your enviorment.
 2.Let the car run until you get a good `brain`.
 3.Save the brain and try again.
 4.You also have additional settings to play around with.
 
 ## Features
- Change the settings of the car, path, traffic, intelligence, activation function.
- Refresh option because the javascrip language is not optimal for machine learning.
- Short Presentation about the project(that you probably cant understand the language :( my humor is bad sorry).
- Save and delete options for the brain.
- Save, load and delete options for the settings.
- A visual representation of the neural network.

## Future features
- Automatic generation start.
- Changing the shape of the road and implementing a map API.
- Better selection of the best brain.
